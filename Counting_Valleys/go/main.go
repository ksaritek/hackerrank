/*
An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly  steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill, , or a downhill,  step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a  unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:

A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.
Given the sequence of up and down steps during a hike, find and print the number of valleys walked through.

# Example

The hiker first enters a valley  units deep. Then they climb out and up onto a mountain  units high. Finally, the hiker returns to sea level and ends the hike.

# Function Description

Complete the countingValleys function in the editor below.

countingValleys has the following parameter(s):

int steps: the number of steps on the hike
string path: a string describing the path
Returns

int: the number of valleys traversed
Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of steps in the hike.
The second line contains a single string , of  characters that describe the path.

# Constraints

# Sample Input

8
UDDDUDUU
Sample Output

1
Explanation

If we represent _ as sea level, a step up as /, and a step down as \, the hike can be drawn as:

_/\      _

	\    /
	 \/\/

The hiker enters and leaves one valley.
